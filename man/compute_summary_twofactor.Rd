\title{Compute Summary Statistics for Two-Factor Data}
\usage{
compute_summary_twofactor(
  df,
  groupwise_measurevar,
  subject_keyword,
  model_iv1,
  model_iv2,
  dv
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing the data for analysis.}

\item{groupwise_measurevar}{The name of the variable for which to calculate group-wise measures.}

\item{subject_keyword}{The name of the variable identifying subjects in the dataset.}

\item{model_iv1}{The name of the first independent variable (factor) in the model.}

\item{model_iv2}{The name of the second independent variable (factor) in the model.}

\item{dv}{The name of the dependent variable in the dataset.}
}
\value{
A list containing two dataframes: the first (`subjectwise`) contains mean summaries
  for each combination of subject and independent variables; the second (`groupwise`) contains
  summary statistics with standard errors within groups defined by the independent variables.
}
\description{
This function computes summary statistics for data with two factors. It sources
utility scripts from the current script directory, calculates mean summaries for
each subject and group, and provides a summary with standard errors within groups.
}
\examples{
# Assuming df is your dataframe and appropriate variables are defined:
# result <- compute_summary_twofactor(df, "measure_var", "subjectID",
#                                    "factor1", "factor2", "dependentVar")
